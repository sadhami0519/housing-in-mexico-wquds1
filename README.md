# Housing in Mexico 🏡🇲🇽

## About the Project

In this project, I explored a dataset containing information on over 21,000 properties for sale in Mexico, sourced from the real estate website Properati.com. My main goal was to determine whether sale prices are influenced more by **property size** or **location**.

Through this analysis, I gained hands-on experience with several key data science skills, including:

- Organizing information using basic Python data structures
- Importing and cleaning data from CSV files using the `pandas` library
- Creating visualizations such as scatter plots and box plots
- Investigating the relationship between two variables using correlation

This project was completed as part of WorldQuant University's **Applied Data Science Lab**.
